## Simple Calculator Project

this is my first web calculator project

from the designing to coding I did the whole thing by myself with the intention of doing one better in the future to know how much I have improved

while I did not follow all the design guidelines I know I thought it wouldn't matter because this is not the last calculator I plan on making

I learned a lot of things and improved on my current knowledge of the tools I used

### Tools used :

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JAVASCRIPT
4. FIGMA

### Lessons learned

1. implement the best solution from the start do not do a half job and plan on fixing it later
2. design the whole logic from the start with leaving room to add new features
3. it is ok to take inspiration from other people designs
4. MAKE THE DESIGN RESPONSIVE FROM THE START , IT IS A NIGHTMARE TO EDIT LATTER
