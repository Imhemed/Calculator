for now I only plan on making it do one operation at a time but Plan on improving it in the future

so the design is finished

the logic is mostly finished I just need to fix the state transition of the second number because right now it only adds number to the first number not the second

coding after the mockup design is finished is the best you do not need to adjust padding and spacing

the figma dev mode is amazing I hope it stays free but I doubt it it has good fetures but it is far from being perfect like you can't just use it and expact a designer to write the full Css

tommorow is the last day of this project
